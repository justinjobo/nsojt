.SH "NAME"
nct-check \- Deprecated\&. Should not be used\&. Check the availability of a cluster of nodes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBnct\-check\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The nct\-check(1) is a command for checking that the Host access over SSH is ok, that various NCS API\(cqs are running and if HA is configured\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-c, \-\-cmd\fR \fICMD\fR
.RS 4
The type of check to be executed is controlled by this switch\&. The default is
\fIall\fR, i\&.e to do all the available checks\&. Other types are:
\fIssh\fR
(check SSH access is ok),
\fIssh\-sudo\fR
(check that SSH and SUDO is possible), \(oqdisk\-usage\(cq (return some disk usage information),
\fIrestconf\fR
(is the RESTCONF API accessible),
\fInetconf\fR
(is the NETCONF API accessible),
\fIncs\-vsn\fR
(what NCS version is the RESTCONF API announcing),
\fIha\fR
(is HA configured and if so how)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disk\-limit\fR \fIDISKLIMIT\fR
.RS 4
The \(oqdisk\-usage\(cq check will attach a
\fIWARNING\fR
label in the output if the disk usage is above
\fIDISKLIMIT\fR\&. Default is
\fI80\fR
percent\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-netconf\-pass\fR \fINETCONFPASS\fR
.RS 4
The NETCONF password to be used (default: admin)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-netconf\-port\fR \fINETCONFPORT\fR
.RS 4
The NETCONF Port number to be used (default: 2022)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-netconf\-proto\fR \fINETCONFPORT\fR
.RS 4
The NETCONF bearer protocol to be used (default: ssh)\&. Currently, only
\fIssh\fR
is supported\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-netconf\-user\fR \fINETCONFUSER\fR
.RS 4
The NETCONF user to be used (default: admin)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-restconf\-pass\fR \fIRESTCONFPASS\fR
.RS 4
The RESTCONF password to be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-restconf\-port\fR \fIRESTCONFPORT\fR
.RS 4
The RESTCONF Port number to be used (default: 8889)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-restconf\-user\fR \fIRESTCONFUSER\fR
.RS 4
The RESTCONF user to be used (default: $USER)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-restconf\-ssl\fR \fIBOOLEAN\fR
.RS 4
RESTCONF via SSL true/false (default: true)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-cmd\fR \fISSHCMD\fR
.RS 4
The
\fISSHCMD\fR
argument is a string that can contain any shell command, or sequence of shell commands, that you want to execute on the host(s)\&. Note that the command(s) are executed as the
\fISSHUSER\fR
so you may have to run the commands with
\fIsudo\fR
for root privileges and such\&. Example: "sudo mv /tmp/foo /etc/bar"\&. Tips: if it is a long running command you may want to use the
\fInohup\fR
command on the host(s)\&. See the
\fInohup\fR
man\-page\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-install\-dir \fR\fB\fIInstallDir\fR\fR
.RS 4
This is the directory where static files, primarily the code and libraries for the NCS daemon, are installed\&. The actual directory used for a given invocation of the installation script is
\fIInstallDir\fR/ncs\-VSN, allowing for coexistence of multiple installed versions\&. The currently active version is identified by a symbolic link
\fIInstallDir\fR/current
pointing to one of the
ncs\-VSN
directories\&. If the
\fB\-\-install\-dir\fR
option is omitted,
/opt/ncs
will be used for
\fIInstallDir\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-concurrent\fR \fIBOOL\fR
.RS 4
Each
\fIHOST\fR
will be operated upon concurrently\&. The default value is
\fItrue\fR\&. If set to
\fIfalse\fR, each
\fIHOST\fR
will be dealt with in sequence\&. Obviously, the default behaviour often results in a faster total execution time\&. However, when debugging a command it can be useful to only execute one
\fIHOST\fR
at a time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-name\fR \fINAME\fR
.RS 4
Restrict the command to only operate on the given
\fINAME\fR\&. See the
NAME section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-group\fR \fIGROUP\fR[,\fIGROUP\fR]
.RS 4
Restrict the command to only operate on the given
\fIGROUP\fR
or groups\&. See the
GROUPS section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-groupoper\fR \fIGROUPOPER\fR
.RS 4
If several groups are specified with the
\fI\-\-group\fR
switch\&. This switch defines if the union or intersection of those groups should be used\&. Possible values are:
\fIor\fR
(default) or:
\fIand\fR\&. See the
GROUPS section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Will print out a short help text and then terminate the command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h, \-\-host\fR \fIHOST\fR[,\fIHOST\fR]+
.RS 4
Define one
\fIHOST\fR, or several comma separated
\fIHOST\fR\&. The given hosts are the ones the command will operate upon\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-hostsfile\fR \fIHOSTSFILE\fR
.RS 4
The
\fIHOSTSFILE\fR
containing the
\fIHOST\fR
entries\&. See the
HOSTSFILE section\&. By setting the environment variable \(oqNCT_HOSTSFILE\(cq to
\fIHOSTSFILE\fR
this switch can be omitted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-progress\fR \fIBOOL\fR
.RS 4
If
\fIBOOL\fR
is
\fItrue\fR, then some progress indication will be displayed\&. The default is
\fIfalse\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-user\fR \fIUSER\fR
.RS 4
The user passed the ncs_cli command, with the ncs_cli \-u flag\&. If not present the
\fI\-u\fR
flag will not be used by ncs_cli, resulting in the user being the
\fISSHUSER\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-key\-name\fR \fISSHKEYNAME\fR
.RS 4
Per default, the default filename of the SSH key pair will be used; for example `id_rsa\*(Aq for RSA keys, or `id_ed25519\*(Aq for ED25519 keys\&. To override this behaviour you can specify another key name using this switch\&. See also the
SSH section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-pass\fR \fISSHPASS\fR
.RS 4
The SSH password to be used\&. See also the
SSH section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-port\fR \fISSHPORT\fR
.RS 4
The SSH Port number to be used (default: 22)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-timeout\fR \fISSHTIMEOUT\fR
.RS 4
This switch is only needed in case the default timeout, which is
\fIinfinity\fR, need to be changed\&. The SSH timeout is specified in milliseconds\&. Depending on the type of operation\&. This timeout may have to be increased\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-user\fR \fISSHUSER\fR
.RS 4
The SSH user to be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sudo\-pass\fR \fISUDOPASS\fR
.RS 4
The optional sudo password to be used if the ssh\-command is prompting for a password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sudo\-prompt\fR \fISUDOPROMPT\fR
.RS 4
If a command that runs over SSH uses \*(Aqsudo\*(Aq, and \*(Aqsudo\*(Aq requires a password for the NCT user, this switch decides what prompt to use, so that NCT can match for it and provide a password\&. Normally this switch is not intended to be used, as a default value exists\&. The default is
\fINCT\-sudo\-prompt:\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR \fITIMEOUT\fR
.RS 4
This switch is only needed in case the default timeout, which is
\fIinfinity\fR, need to be changed\&. A general timeout which may expire if the ongoing operations takes a too long time to finish\&. In this case it may be good to increase this value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR \fIVERBOSE\fR
.RS 4
To increase the output two verbose levels exist\&. Level
\fI2\fR
will output as much information as possible\&. Level
\fI1\fR
will output a little less information\&. This is mostly useful debugging a command\&.
.RE
.SS "HOSTSFILE"
.sp
The \fIHOSTSFILE\fR contains entries, called Tuples, looking like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.98", OPTIONS}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.99", OPTIONS}\&.
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note the dot at the end of each Tuple, it is significant\&. The \fIOPTIONS\fR is a list containing options\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.98", [ {ssh_user,"bill"} , \&.\&.\&. ] }\&.
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.98", [ {ssh_user,"bill"} , \&.\&.\&. ] }\&.
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The \fIOPTIONS\fR is enclosed with \fI[\fR \fI]\fR brackets\&. Each option consist of a Tuple with a \fIKEY\fR and a \fIVALUE\fR\&. The \fIKEY\fR mostly corresponds to a command switch, where the \(oq\-\(cq in a switch corresponds to a: \(oq_\(cq in the hostsfile (e\&.g \-\-ssh\-user vs ssh_user)\&. An unary switch is represented as just the switch name\&.
.SS "GROUPS"
.sp
Often it can be useful to be able to group a subset of the \fIHosts\fR in the hostsfile when you want to restrict an operation to only those \fIHosts\fR\&. This can be done with the group mechanism\&. Study the example below:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.99",[{groups,["service","london"]}, \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.24\&.98",[{groups,["service","paris"]},  \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.11",[{groups,["device","london"]},  \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.24\&.12",[{groups,["device","paris"]},   \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In the example above, we have 4 NCS nodes grouped into two groups named: "london" and: "paris" but also two other groups named: "service" and: "device"\&. Imagine that we may want to do certain operations only on the members in the "london" group or perhaps only on the members in the "device" group\&. This can easily be achieved by using the \(oq\-\-group\(cq switch to a NCS tools command\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
nct upgrade \-\-group paris \&.\&.\&.
nct stop \-\-group service \&.\&.\&.
nct check \-\-group london,device \-\-groupoper and \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In the last example we specify two groups and require the (to be) affected \fIHosts\fR to be member in both groups\&. This is controlled by the \(oq\-\-groupoper and\*(Aq switch which means that the intersection of the specified groups should yield the affected \*(AqHosts\*(Aq\&. The default of the group mechanism is to use the union if several groups are specified (`\-\-groupoper or\(cq)\&.
.SS "SSH"
.sp
It is possible to specify the \(oqSSH User\(cq and \(oqSSH Password\(cq to be used for each Host, either with a switch to a command or in the \fIhostsfile\fR\&. It is recommended to add the \(oqSSH Password\(cq to the \fIhostsfile\fR and prohibit other users read access to the file for security reasons\&.
.sp
It is also possible to use \(oqSSH KEYS\(cq as long as they do not require a passphrase\&.
.sp
Then, for each \fIHost\fR, setup the SSH key authentication\&. This can easily be done with the \(oqssh\-copy\-id\(cq command\&.

Per default, the default filename of the SSH key pair will be used; for example \fIid_rsa\fR for RSA keys, or \fIid_ed25519\fR for ED25519 keys\&. To override this behaviour you can use the \fI\-\-ssh\-key\-name\fR switch with any NCT command\&.

For security reasons, it is not recommended to login as \fIroot\fR on the target machines\&. Instead, create a user on the target where you install the SSH key, and then use \fIsudo\fR to gain root privileges on the target machine\&.

.RE
.SS "NAME"
.sp
You can select a specific host from the hostsfile by a given name if you have added name entries in the hostsfile\&. Study the example below:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.99",[{name, "pariss"}, \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.98",[{name, "londons"}, \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
With the above in your hostsfile, you can select a host by name:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
nct upgrade \-\-name pariss \-\-hostsfile \&.\&.\&.
nct stop \-\-name londons \-\-hostsfile \&.\&.\&.
