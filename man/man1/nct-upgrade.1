.SH "NAME"
nct-upgrade \- Deprecated\&. Should not be used\&. Install an NCS release on host(s)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBnct\-upgrade\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The nct\-upgrade(1) command will upgrade an NCS release on the specified host(s) using the \(oq\-\-cmd\(cq and \(oq\-\-ncs\-vsn\(cq switches\&. The default is to first do an NCS backup and to reload any packages\&. This behaviour can be changed with the \(oq\-\-backup\(cq and \(oq\-\-reload_packages\(cq switches\&.
.sp
When doing an upgrade, this command will do the following:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-backup\fR \fIBOOL\fR
.RS 4
If \(oqtrue\(cq (default), an NCS backup will be performed before the NCS upgrade takes place\&. This can be turned off by specifying \(oqfalse\(cq as the
\fIBOOL\fR
value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c, \-\-cmd\fR \fICMD\fR
.RS 4
The
\fICMD\fR
can be either
\fIupgrade\fR
(default) or
\fIavailable\fR\&. The former will perform an NCS upgrade and the latter will show all installed releases on host(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ncs\-vsn\fR \fINCSVSN\fR
.RS 4
The
\fINCSVSN\fR
is a string containing the NCS version number\&. Example: \(oq3\&.2\&.1\(cq
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-reload\-packages\fR \fIBOOL\fR
.RS 4
If \(oqtrue\(cq (default), any packages will be reloaded when the new (upgraded) NCS is started\&. This can be turned off by setting the
\fIBOOL\fR
value to \(oqfalse\(cq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-install\-dir \fR\fB\fIInstallDir\fR\fR
.RS 4
This is the directory where static files, primarily the code and libraries for the NCS daemon, are installed\&. The actual directory used for a given invocation of the installation script is
\fIInstallDir\fR/ncs\-VSN, allowing for coexistence of multiple installed versions\&. The currently active version is identified by a symbolic link
\fIInstallDir\fR/current
pointing to one of the
ncs\-VSN
directories\&. If the
\fB\-\-install\-dir\fR
option is omitted,
/opt/ncs
will be used for
\fIInstallDir\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-concurrent\fR \fIBOOL\fR
.RS 4
Each
\fIHOST\fR
will be operated upon concurrently\&. The default value is
\fItrue\fR\&. If set to
\fIfalse\fR, each
\fIHOST\fR
will be dealt with in sequence\&. Obviously, the default behaviour often results in a faster total execution time\&. However, when debugging a command it can be useful to only execute one
\fIHOST\fR
at a time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-name\fR \fINAME\fR
.RS 4
Restrict the command to only operate on the given
\fINAME\fR\&. See the
NAME section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-group\fR \fIGROUP\fR[,\fIGROUP\fR]
.RS 4
Restrict the command to only operate on the given
\fIGROUP\fR
or groups\&. See the
GROUPS section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-groupoper\fR \fIGROUPOPER\fR
.RS 4
If several groups are specified with the
\fI\-\-group\fR
switch\&. This switch defines if the union or intersection of those groups should be used\&. Possible values are:
\fIor\fR
(default) or:
\fIand\fR\&. See the
GROUPS section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Will print out a short help text and then terminate the command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h, \-\-host\fR \fIHOST\fR[,\fIHOST\fR]+
.RS 4
Define one
\fIHOST\fR, or several comma separated
\fIHOST\fR\&. The given hosts are the ones the command will operate upon\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-hostsfile\fR \fIHOSTSFILE\fR
.RS 4
The
\fIHOSTSFILE\fR
containing the
\fIHOST\fR
entries\&. See the
HOSTSFILE section\&. By setting the environment variable \(oqNCT_HOSTSFILE\(cq to
\fIHOSTSFILE\fR
this switch can be omitted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-progress\fR \fIBOOL\fR
.RS 4
If
\fIBOOL\fR
is
\fItrue\fR, then some progress indication will be displayed\&. The default is
\fIfalse\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-user\fR \fIUSER\fR
.RS 4
The user passed the ncs_cli command, with the ncs_cli \-u flag\&. If not present the
\fI\-u\fR
flag will not be used by ncs_cli, resulting in the user being the
\fISSHUSER\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-key\-name\fR \fISSHKEYNAME\fR
.RS 4
Per default, the default filename of the SSH key pair will be used; for example `id_rsa\*(Aq for RSA keys, or `id_ed25519\*(Aq for ED25519 keys\&. To override this behaviour you can specify another key name using this switch\&. See also the
SSH section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-pass\fR \fISSHPASS\fR
.RS 4
The SSH password to be used\&. See also the
SSH section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-port\fR \fISSHPORT\fR
.RS 4
The SSH Port number to be used (default: 22)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-timeout\fR \fISSHTIMEOUT\fR
.RS 4
This switch is only needed in case the default timeout, which is
\fIinfinity\fR, need to be changed\&. The SSH timeout is specified in milliseconds\&. Depending on the type of operation\&. This timeout may have to be increased\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-user\fR \fISSHUSER\fR
.RS 4
The SSH user to be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sudo\-pass\fR \fISUDOPASS\fR
.RS 4
The optional sudo password to be used if the ssh\-command is prompting for a password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sudo\-prompt\fR \fISUDOPROMPT\fR
.RS 4
If a command that runs over SSH uses \*(Aqsudo\*(Aq, and \*(Aqsudo\*(Aq requires a password for the NCT user, this switch decides what prompt to use, so that NCT can match for it and provide a password\&. Normally this switch is not intended to be used, as a default value exists\&. The default is
\fINCT\-sudo\-prompt:\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR \fITIMEOUT\fR
.RS 4
This switch is only needed in case the default timeout, which is
\fIinfinity\fR, need to be changed\&. A general timeout which may expire if the ongoing operations takes a too long time to finish\&. In this case it may be good to increase this value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR \fIVERBOSE\fR
.RS 4
To increase the output two verbose levels exist\&. Level
\fI2\fR
will output as much information as possible\&. Level
\fI1\fR
will output a little less information\&. This is mostly useful debugging a command\&.
.RE
.SS "HOSTSFILE"
.sp
The \fIHOSTSFILE\fR contains entries, called Tuples, looking like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.98", OPTIONS}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.99", OPTIONS}\&.
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note the dot at the end of each Tuple, it is significant\&. The \fIOPTIONS\fR is a list containing options\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.98", [ {ssh_user,"bill"} , \&.\&.\&. ] }\&.
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.98", [ {ssh_user,"bill"} , \&.\&.\&. ] }\&.
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The \fIOPTIONS\fR is enclosed with \fI[\fR \fI]\fR brackets\&. Each option consist of a Tuple with a \fIKEY\fR and a \fIVALUE\fR\&. The \fIKEY\fR mostly corresponds to a command switch, where the \(oq\-\(cq in a switch corresponds to a: \(oq_\(cq in the hostsfile (e\&.g \-\-ssh\-user vs ssh_user)\&. An unary switch is represented as just the switch name\&.
.SS "GROUPS"
.sp
Often it can be useful to be able to group a subset of the \fIHosts\fR in the hostsfile when you want to restrict an operation to only those \fIHosts\fR\&. This can be done with the group mechanism\&. Study the example below:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.99",[{groups,["service","london"]}, \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.24\&.98",[{groups,["service","paris"]},  \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.23\&.11",[{groups,["device","london"]},  \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
{"192\&.168\&.24\&.12",[{groups,["device","paris"]},   \&.\&.\&. ]}\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In the example above, we have 4 NCS nodes grouped into two groups named: "london" and: "paris" but also two other groups named: "service" and: "device"\&. Imagine that we may want to do certain operations only on the members in the "london" group or perhaps only on the members in the "device" group\&. This can easily be achieved by using the \(oq\-\-group\(cq switch to a NCS tools command\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
nct upgrade \-\-group paris \&.\&.\&.
nct stop \-\-group service \&.\&.\&.
nct check \-\-group london,device \-\-groupoper and \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In the last example we specify two groups and require the (to be) affected \fIHosts\fR to be member in both groups\&. This is controlled by the \(oq\-\-groupoper and\*(Aq switch which means that the intersection of the specified groups should yield the affected \*(AqHosts\*(Aq\&. The default of the group mechanism is to use the union if several groups are specified (`\-\-groupoper or\(cq)\&.
.SS "SSH"
.sp
It is possible to specify the \(oqSSH User\(cq and \(oqSSH Password\(cq to be used for each Host, either with a switch to a command or in the \fIhostsfile\fR\&. It is recommended to add the \(oqSSH Password\(cq to the \fIhostsfile\fR and prohibit other users read access to the file for security reasons\&.
.sp
It is also possible to use \(oqSSH KEYS\(cq as long as they do not require a passphrase\&.
.sp
Then, for each \fIHost\fR, setup the SSH key authentication\&. This can easily be done with the \(oqssh\-copy\-id\(cq command\&.

Per default, the default filename of the SSH key pair will be used; for example \fIid_rsa\fR for RSA keys, or \fIid_ed25519\fR for ED25519 keys\&. To override this behaviour you can use the \fI\-\-ssh\-key\-name\fR switch with any NCT command\&.

For security reasons, it is not recommended to login as \fIroot\fR on the target machines\&. Instead, create a user on the target where you install the SSH key, and then use \fIsudo\fR to gain root privileges on the target machine\&.

You can select a specific host from the hostsfile by a given name if you have added name entries in the hostsfile\&. Study the example below:
