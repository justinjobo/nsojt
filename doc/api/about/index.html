            Welcome to Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) SDK API
            reference.
            The APIs described here are designed for extending the functionality of the
            product, such as adding custom service code or exposing data through data
            provider mechanism. You might think of them as a kind of a plugin API.
              
         </p>
         <p>
            If you are just trying to read data or push configuration from another
                system, consider using one of the so-called Northbound Interfaces (NBIs)
                instead. NBIs were designed to let other systems interact with NSO
                and you might find them easier to use. One of them exposes a REST-style
                interface, for example. Please consult the northbound interface-specific
                parts of documentation for more information.
              
         </p>
         <p>
                The SDK API reference is automatically generated from the programming
                library source code. You can also access this same information inside your
                Integrated Development Environment (IDE), if your IDE supports it.
              
         </p>
         <p>
                Bindings are available for multiple programming languages and provide
                roughly the same functionality but differ in the level of abstraction on
                top of the core API. For example, Python bindings implement additional,
                higher-level classes and functions to make the API easier to use.
              
         </p>
         <p>
                The reference describes individual functions and classes but provides very
                few complete examples. It is <span class="emphasis"><em>strongly</em></span> recommended to
                read the Development guide first. It contains many examples and explains
                the data modelling and transaction concepts required for you to efficiently
                use the APIs described here. Development guide is available at
                <a class="link" href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/guides/" target="_top">https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/guides/</a>,
                along with other product documentation.

                 Cisco Network Service Orchestrator (NSO) version 6.2.5
                 is an evolution of the Tail-f Network Control System (NCS).
                 Tail-f was acquired by Cisco in 2014. The product has been enhanced
                 and forms the base for Cisco NSO.
               
                 Note that the terms 'ncs' and 'tail-f' are used extensively in file
                 names, command-line command names, YANG models, application
                 programming interfaces (API), etc. Throughout this document we will
                 use NSO to mean the product, which consists of a number of
                 tools and executables. These executable components will be referred
                 to by their command line name, e.g. <span class="command"><strong>ncs</strong></span>,
                 <span class="command"><strong>ncs-netsim</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>ncs_cli</strong></span>, etc.
