ConfD SNMP Agent - YANG files for built-in MIBs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The YANG models in compiled form (.fxs) are needed by 
the ConfD SNMP Agent in order to work.
Tampering with these models is NOT advised, and
may result in a non-working system.

A Makefile and source code for the YANG files
is provided so that the .fxs files may be 
rebuilt using optional compiler flags only, 
for example to limit access to the SNMP Agent configuration data 
from other protocols besides SNMP. 

Modify the Makefile and insert the compiler flag "--export snmp"
for .yang files that should only be accessible for the SNMP Agent.
See manual page for confdc(1) for more information.

The generated .h files are necessary when we wish to e.g. write
transformation code that transforms from the MIBs onto a high level
data model.
