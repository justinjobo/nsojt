This is a generated Python package, made by:

  ncs-make-package --nano-service-skeleton %SERVICE_TYPE% \
                   --component-class %COMP_CLASS% %NAME%

It contains a dummy YANG model which implements a minimal Service
that doesn't really do anything useful. They are there just to get
you going.
