The NSO Example Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NSO example collection contains everything from tiny to medium-sized and
from trivial to expert-use examples. The example set has an NSO application
developer focus, but many examples lend themselves well to administrators.

Many examples have been added on request or when a new feature was added, not
in a beginner-to-expert order. Therefore, to assist new and expert NSO
application developers and administrators in navigating the example set, the
list below is in the order a typical new NSO user would consume the examples.
In addition, each example in the list below has a summary to assist users of
all experiences find the example they are looking for. Finally, there are
pointers to where in the NSO documentation the example is described, if
applicable.

All Makefiles in the example collection will check for the $NCS_DIR variable.
Thus the 'ncsrc' file under the NSO local install root directory, where the
$NCS_DIR variable points to, must be sourced before running the examples.

$ source /path/to/ncs-<ncs-vsn>/ncsrc

ConfD, from now on called netsim, is used by many examples to simulate managed
devices with NETCONF, CLI, or SNMP northbound interfaces.

See each example for a detailed description, additional requirements, and
pointers for further reading.
