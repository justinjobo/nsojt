Service Delete Best Practice
============================

This example includes a service, bgp-routing, that configures a new BGP
neighbor. However, this configuration is not compatible with the pre-existing
configuration (a different BGP neighbor), which must be removed as part of
service provisioning. As a best practice, the service implements "shared
delete" through another helper service, called bgp-clean.

Start the example by running: make demo

By going through bgp-clean service, bgp-routing can rely on NSO tracking
which service instances still require removal of the incompatible BGP
neighbor. You can observe this through service meta data on the bgp-clean
service instance. Since there is only ever a single instance of bgp-clean
service per device, there is no risk of multiple overlapping or interfering
deletes.

A number of sample service instances are preconfigured for you. The bad1 and
bad2 instances do not use the helper bgp-clean. If you remove the one that
was provisioned first, the 1.2.3.4 neighbor will show up again. Compare this
to good1 and good2 instance, where removal of both is required for initial
configuration to be reinstated.

When you are done with the example, run: make stop
