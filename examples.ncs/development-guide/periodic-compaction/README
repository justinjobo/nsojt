Periodic Compaction Automation with NSO Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example showcases how compaction could be automated using the NSO scheduler
with a simple dedicated compaction task.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This example creates a NSO task `compaction-task`. When triggered, the task uses
CDB API to fetch current status information about the CDB datastores. Based on
this information, the task requests journal compaction for those datastores
where it is deemed required.

Furthermore, the example uses the NSO scheduler to set up an automatic trigger
of the compaction task.

Note that the ncs.conf used in this example has been prepared with manual
compaction enabled and delayed compaction disabled.

    <compaction>
        <journal-compaction>manual</journal-compaction>
        <delayed-compaction-timeout>PT0S</delayed-compaction-timeout>
    </compaction>

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a shell script available that runs the example. Run the script by
typing:

        $ make showcase
