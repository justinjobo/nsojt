Creating a Service Showcases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example is an implementation of the "A Simple DNS Configuration Service"
and "DNS Configuration Service with Templates" showcases that are described in
detail in the NSO Development Guide Chapter "Creating a Service".

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a shell script available that runs the example according to the
showcase steps described in the Development Guide documentation. Run the script
by typing:

        $ make showcase

The above shell script uses the NSO CLI as the northbound interface. There is
also a Python script variant that uses the NSO RESTCONF northbound interface.
Run it by typing:

        $ make showcase-rc
