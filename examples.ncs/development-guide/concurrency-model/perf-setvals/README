Optimizing the Service Create Callback Performance
==================================================

Suppose a service creates a significant amount of configuration data for
devices. In that case, it is often significantly faster to use a single MAAPI
`shared_set_values()` call instead of using multiple `create()` and `set()`
calls or a service template.

The MAAPI Python `shared_set_values()` and Java `sharedSetValues()` can take
an array of tag-values or XML as input and set the configuration instead of
using one API call and context switch for each value.

In this example, we explore the opportunities to improve the wall-clock
time performance using MAAPI `shared_set_values()` and by utilizing the multiple
CPU cores when writing to more than one device.

The example writes configuration to an access control list and a route list of
a Cisco ASA device. It uses either MAAPI Python `create()` and `set()` calls,
Python `shared_set_values()`, or Java `sharedSetValues()` to write the
configuration in XML format.

The example uses the NSO progress trace feature to get detailed timing
information for the transactions in the system. The provided code sets up an
NSO instance that exports tracing data to a .csv file and provisions one or
more service instances. The simple progress trace viewer Python script can then
be used to show a graph to visualize the sequences and concurrency.

Running the Example
-------------------

First, make sure no existing netsim or NSO instances are running. To run the
example using MAAPI Python `create()` and `set()` calls to create 3000 rules and
3000 routes on one device:

        $ ./measure.sh -r 3000 -t py_create -n true

The commit uses the `no-networking` parameter to skip pushing the configuration
to the simulated and un-proportionally slow Cisco ASA netsim device.

Next, run the example using a single MAAPI Python `shared_set_values()` call to
create 3000 rules and 3000 routes on one device:

        ./measure.sh -r 3000 -t py_setvals_xml -n true

Using the MAAPI `shared_set_values()` function, the service create callback is,
for this example, ~5x faster than using the MAAPI `create()` and `set()`
functions. The total wall-clock time for the transaction is more than 2x faster,
and the difference will increase for transactions with larger configurations.

To run the example using a single MAAPI Java `sharedSetValues()` call to create
3000 rules and 3000 routes on one device with a similar result as with Python:

        ./measure.sh -r 3000 -t j_setvals_xml -n true

As with the `perf-trans` example, when deploying the service configuration to
several devices, this example follows the best practice design pattern of
configuring one device per service instance. Using one transaction per
service instance enables NSO to use one CPU core per service instance and run
the transactions concurrently.

To run the example and set the configuration to two devices

        ./measure.sh -d 2 -r 3000 -t py_setvals_xml -n true

Notice how the create callback and saving the reverse diff-set for each device
run in parallel.

Change the -d <number> flag to add devices. For all available options, see the
`measure.sh` script for details:

        ./measure.sh -h
        ./measure.sh [-d <num_devs> -r <num_routes> -t <test> -q <use_cq> \
                      -n <no_networking> -h <help>]
