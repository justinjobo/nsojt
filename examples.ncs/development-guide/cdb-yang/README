The Configuration Database and YANG Showcases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example is an implementation of the "Extending the CDB with Packages"
and "Building and Testing a Model" showcases that are described in detail in the
NSO Development Guide Chapter "The Configuration Database and YANG".

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a shell script available that runs the example according to the
showcase steps described in the Development Guide documentation. Run the script
by typing:

        $ make showcase

The above shell script uses the NSO CLI as the northbound interface. There is
also a Python script variant that uses the NSO RESTCONF northbound interface.
Run it by typing:

        $ make showcase-rc
