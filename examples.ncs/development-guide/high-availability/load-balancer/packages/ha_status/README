HA STATUS
~~~~~~~~~

This package implements a very simple web server for publishing NSO HA status.
The reason for a separate server is to provide this information without
authentication, so clients (typically load balancers or proxies) can identify
the active node where they can send (write) requests.

The server by default listens on TCP port 8765 but can be configured through
environment variables HASTATUS_ADDR and HASTATUS_PORT to bind to a different
address/port combination.

Since the web server runs as a package, NSO is responsible for starting and
stopping it, as part of package management. The server implements two
endpoints:

GET /ha_status
        Returns in the response body as plain text the current value of the
        /ncs-state/ha/mode leaf. Unless there was an error, HTTP status code
        is 200 OK.

GET /ha_writable
        Returns HTTP status code 200 OK and value 'true' in the body if this
        node is currently the HA leader/primary and can therefore take write
        requests. Otherwise, 409 Conflict status code with 'false' in the body
        is returned, in order to allow checks to rely on the status code.
        In this last case, the status code can be changed from 409 through
        the HASTATUS_NWCODE environment variable if required.
