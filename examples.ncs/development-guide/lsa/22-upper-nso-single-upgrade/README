Upgrading NSO for an LSA Upper Layer instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example extends the developing-with-ncs/22-lsa-single-version-deployment
example, aka 22-layered-service-architecture pre-NSO 5.4, and implements a
simple shell script to show how an NSO version upgrade of the upper NSO
instance can performed. This example upgrade NSO for an LSA single version
deployment.

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a shell script available that runs the example. Run the script and
step through an upgrade by typing:

        $ make start

The shell script will then use default values and perform the upgrade steps to
upgrade the upper NSO instance of the
22-lsa-single-version-deployment/layered-service-architecture example to the
same NSO version for demo purposes. To, for example, upgrade the NSO 4.7.10
22-layered-service-architecture example upper layer NSO instance to the version
that the NCS_DIR environment variable points to, replace the
"/Users/tailf/nso-4.7.10" path below with the location of NSO 4.7.10 in your
system and type:

        $Â ./upper_nso_upgrade.sh -o 4.7.10 -d /Users/tailf/nso-4.7.10

Replace the version number above to match the version you want to upgrade from.
Use the -p and -n flags to point out an NSO version to upgrade the upper LSA
layer NSO to that is different than what the NCS_DIR environment variable points
to.

When, for example, upgrading the upper LSA NSO instance from NSO 4.7.10 to NSO
5.7, the following steps in the script are important to such upgrades:

0. Backup
1. Replace the old NSO 4.7.10 tailf/cisco-nso-nc-4.7 package with the NSO 5.7
   NETCONF NED package for 4.7.
2. Update the Makefile for the rfs-ned package and rebuild it.
3. Add the --ncs-ned-id tailf-ncs-ned:lsa-netconf flag when upgrading from NSO
   4.7 to 5.x.
4. Rebuild the RFS NED package.
5. Make the necessary changes to ncs.conf to upgrade from NSO 4.7.10 to 5.7.
6. When upgrading from NSO 4.7 to 5.6 or newer we need to add ssh-rsa to the
   list of supported algorithms to the 5.6 or newer upper NSO instance
   configuration.

See the upper_nso_upgrade.sh script for details.
