Upgrading NSO for an LSA Multi-Version Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example extends the developing-with-ncs/28-lsa-multi-version-deployment
example and implements a simple shell script to show how an NSO version upgrade
of the upper NSO instance and one of the lower NSO instances can be performed.

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a shell script available that runs the example. Run the script and
step through an upgrade by typing:

        $ make start

The shell script will then use default values and perform the upgrade steps to
upgrade the upper-nso and lower-nso-1 instances of the 28-lsa-multi-version-
deployment example to the same NSO version for demo purposes. To, for example,
upgrade the NSO 5.4.5 28-lsa-multi-version-deployment example upper layer NSO
instance to the version that the NCS_DIR environment variable points to (e.g.
5.7), replace the "/Users/tailf/nso-5.4.5" path below with the location of NSO
5.4.5 in your system and type:

        $Â ./multiver_nso_upgrade.sh -o 5.4.5 -d /Users/tailf/nso-5.4.5

Replace the version number above to match the version you want to upgrade from.
Use the -p and -n flags to point out an NSO version to upgrade the upper and one
of the lower LSA layer NSO instances to that is different than what the NCS_DIR
environment variable points to. Get more details using the -h flag.

When, for example, upgrading the upper and one of the lower LSA NSO instances
from NSO 5.4.5 to NSO 5.7, the following steps in the script are important for
such upgrades:

0. Backup
1. Rebuild the lower-nso-1 packages with the new NSO 5.7.
2. Make the necessary changes to the lower-nso-1 ncs.conf to upgrade from NSO
   5.4.5 to 5.7.
3. Restart the lower-nso-1 NSO instance and upgrade to 5.7.
4. Rebuild the cfs-vlan package with the new NSO 5.7.
5. Replace the old NSO 5.4.5 tailf/cisco-nso-nc-5.4 package with the NSO 5.7
   NETCONF NED package for 5.4 and add the 5.7 to support both.
6. Copy the rfs-vlan-nc-5.4 to rfs-vlan-nc-5.7 and update the
   package-meta-data.xml + Makefile for the rfs-vlan-nc-5.7 package and rebuild
   the RFS NEDs.
7. Make the necessary changes to the upper-nso ncs.conf to upgrade from NSO
   5.4.5 to 5.7.
8. Restart the upper NSO instance and upgrade to 5.7.
9. Migrate the lower-nso-1 5.4.5 NED ID to 5.7.
