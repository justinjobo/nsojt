Upgrading an LSA Upper Layer instance from single to multi-version deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example extends the developing-with-ncs/22-lsa-single-version-deployment
example, aka 22-layered-service-architecture pre-NSO 5.4, and implements a
simple shell script to show how an NSO version upgrade of the upper NSO
instance can performed while at the same time switching from a single version
to a multi-version deployment.

Note: to upgrade from a pre-5.x single version deployment to a multi-version
NED. First upgrade the pre-5.x instance to a 5.x single version NED. Then
upgrade the 5.x single version to a multi-version NED as described for this
example.

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a shell script available that runs the example. Run the script and
step through an upgrade by typing:

        $ make start

The shell script will then use default values and perform the upgrade steps to
upgrade the upper NSO instance of the
22-lsa-single-version-deployment/layered-service-architecture example to the
same NSO version for demo purposes. To, for example, upgrade the NSO 5.4.5
22-lsa-single-version-deployment example upper layer NSO instance to the version
that the NCS_DIR environment variable points to, replace the
"/Users/tailf/nso-5.4.5" path below with the location of NSO 5.4.5 in your
system and type:

        $Â ./upper_nso_upgrade.sh -o 5.4.5 -d /Users/tailf/nso-5.4.5

Replace the version number above to match the version you want to upgrade from.
Use the -p and -n flags to point out an NSO version to upgrade the upper LSA
layer NSO to that is different than what the NCS_DIR environment variable points
to.

When, for example, upgrading the upper LSA NSO instance from NSO 5.4.5 to NSO
5.7, while switching from a single version deployment to a multi-version
deployment the following steps in the script are important to such upgrades:

0. Backup
1. Replace the old NSO 5.4.5 tailf/cisco-nso-nc-5.4 package with the NSO 5.7
   NETCONF NED package for 5.4.
2. Copy the rfs-vlan-ned to rfs-vlan-nc-5.4.
3. Have the RFS NED makefile --ncs-ned-id flag use the multi-version NED ID.
4. Update the package-meta-data.xml for the rfs-vlan-nc-5.4 package.
5. Rebuild the single and multi-version RFS package.
6. Make the necessary changes to ncs.conf to upgrade from NSO 5.4.5 to 5.7.
   Restart the upper NSO instance and upgrade to 5.7.
7. Migrate the upper NSO single version NED ID to a multi-version NED ID.
8. Delete the single version rfs-vlan-ned package and reload packages.
   Warning: If the migrate to the multi-version NED ID earlier failed, we will
   loose data if we delete the single version NED.

See the upper_nso_upgrade.sh script for details.
