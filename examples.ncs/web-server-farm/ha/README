High Availability Example
=======================

Introduction
------------

This small example tries to exemplify how to use the NCS ha (high availability)
framework. See chapter "High availability" in the user guide.

The example builds and starts two NCS nodes, called n1 and n2 respectively.
Both nodes run on the same host (localhost) using different
NCS_IPC_PORTs

The data models are extremely simple, see the package
$NCS_DIR/packages/services/manual-ha

It basically defines a set of action points allowing the operator
to set the current node to be primary, secondary or none.
The Java/Yang code is found in the package $NCS_DIR/packages/services/manual-ha
implements the actions using the Java API for HA and action callbacks.




Building the Example
--------------------
To build the example execute:

$ make all

Starting the Example
--------------------
To start the example you need to:

1) Open three shells

2) In the first shell, start the simulated network

$ ncs-netsim start

3) in the second shell start NCS node n1:

$ cd n1
$ NCS_IPC_PORT=5757 sname=n1 NCS_HA_NODE=n1 ncs -c ncs.conf

4) in the third shell start NCS node n2:

$ cd n2
$ NCS_IPC_PORT=5758 sname=n2 NCS_HA_NODE=n2 ncs -c ncs.conf

Now everything is up and running, in shell n1 start the NCS CLI towards
that node:

$ NCS_IPC_PORT=5757 ncs_cli -u admin

admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on zoe
admin@zoe> request ha-config be-primary


In shell n2 start the NCS CLI towards that node:

$ NCS_IPC_PORT=5758 ncs_cli -u admin

admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on zoe
admin@zoe> request ha-config be-secondary

Stopping the Example
-------------------

When you are ready with this example make sure all daemons are stopped. Stop
NCS and then the simulated network:

$ NCS_IPC_PORT=5757 sname=n1 ncs --stop
$ NCS_IPC_PORT=5758 sname=n2 ncs --stop
$ ncs-netsim stop

Clean all created files:

$ make clean
