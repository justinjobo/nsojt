This example shows how to incorporate data into an NCS system where
that data is not stored in CDB, it's stored in another database, outside
of NCS.

This example uses two NCS packages.The router package introduced
in ../0-router-network and a package called just 'extern-db' which
implements the "data provider" for the external database.

$ ls ./packages
extern-db    router

To build the two packages, do

$ make all

To start the ncs-netsim network, follow the instructions in
../0-router-network, it's the same network here.

$ ncs-netsim start
DEVICE ex0 OK STARTED
DEVICE ex1 OK STARTED
DEVICE ex2 OK STARTED


To study this example, first take a look at the file
packages/extern-db/package-meta-data.xml

The file says that the package has 1 component

  <component>
    <name>External DB</name>
    <callback>
      <java-class-name>com.example.extdb.App</java-class-name>
    </callback>
  </component>


The code in com.example.extdb.App implements the transaction
callbacks and the data callbacks necessary for a data provider.

To run this example we do

$ ncs
$ ncs_cli -u admin

admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on iron.local
admin@iron> configure

The yang model resides as usual in a package under
packages/extern-db/src/yang/work.yang

There are two things interesting with this yang model,

1. It's configuration data
2. It has a callpoint called tailf:callpoint workPoint;

This means that some external code needs to

a) register under the name of "workPoint"
b) that code needs to participate in the transactions and the
   code is responsible for storing the data

Study the callbacks in com.example.extdb.App



- To start the emulated network, do ncs-netsim start | help
- To start NCS, do ncs [--verbose --foreground]
- To stop NCS, do ncs --stop
- To get a Juniper CLI into NCS, do ncs_cli -u admin

- To restart NCS from scratch, ncs-setup --reset
    this will ensure NCS is reinitialized from the ncs-cdb/*.xml files
    when restarted

- To restart the netsim network from scratch, do
    ncs-netsim stop
    ncs-netsim reset
    ncs-netsim start
       or in one swoop
    ncs-netsim restart
