This is the getting started for developers example collection.

Most of the examples in this example collection make use of an example
network consisting of three fictious routers that run in an ncs-netsim
emulated network.

See manpage ncs-netsim(1) for more information on that.

The simulated network consists of 3 fictious routers. The package
that describes the router in the emulated network resides in
./package/router. The examples that need the simulated network
will have a link to the router package in their ./package directory.

For example,

$ file 1-cdb/packages/router
1-cdb/packages/router: symbolic link to `../../packages/router'

If we take a look at the Makefile in one of the examples, for example
./1-cdb/Makefile, we can see that the ncs-netsim tool is used to
create  an emulated network inside the example by invoking

$ ncs-netsim create-network ./packages/router 3 ex --dir ./netsim

The first example called 0-router-network contains a README which
guides you through this example network, running the device manager
towards the network. Thus the example 0-router-network and in particular
0-router-network/README is a prerequisite for running all the
examples in this collection

The remainder of the examples in this directory are
all targeted towards Java developers. Different aspects on how to write
Java code for NCS are shown. Each directory contains a standalone
example with a README describing the example.
