This example illustrates how to

- define a user defined tailf:action and how to
  attach user code behind that action

- write user code that invokes actions from Java

This example uses two NCS packages.The router package introduced
in ../0-router-network and a package called 'actions' with some
Java code examples

$ ls ./packages
actions  router

To build the two packages, do

$ make all

To start the ncs-netsim network, follow the instructions in
../0-router-network, it's the same network here.

$ ncs-netsim start
DEVICE ex0 OK STARTED
DEVICE ex1 OK STARTED
DEVICE ex2 OK STARTED

All the code for this example resides in
./packages/actions

To run the example we do:

$ ncs

This will start ncs, and ncs will load the two packages, load the
data models defined by the two packages and start the Java code defined
by the packages.



$ ncs_cli -u admin
admin@iron> request action-test system restart mode xx data { debug }

To study this example, first take a look at the file
packages/actions/package-meta-data.xml, it defines one component
which is

  <component>
    <name>actions</name>
    <callback>
      <java-class-name>com.example.actions.ActionCb</java-class-name>
    </callback>
  </component>

This means that the class ActionCb has callbacks of some type, and
we want them registered. Study the file. The yang files in the
'actions' package reside under ./packages/actions/src/yang
The file action-test.yang defines a number of actions and the code in
ActionCb.java implements the actions.

Invoke the user defined action from the CLI as:


The file Sync.java does the opposite of ActionCb, it calls on
an existing action in the loaded YANG models. To invoke the
Sync code do

$ cd packages/actions/src/java
$ ant call-sync



- To start the emulated network, do ncs-netsim start | help
- To start NCS, do ncs  [--verbose --foreground]
- To stop NCS, do ncs --stop
- To get a Juniper CLI into NCS, do ncs_cli -u admin

- To restart NCS from scratch, ncs-setup --reset
    this will ensure NCS is reinitialized from the ncs-cdb/*.xml files
    when restarted

- To restart the netsim network from scratch, do
    ncs-netsim stop
    ncs-netsim reset
    ncs-netsim start
       or in one swoop
    ncs-netsim restart
