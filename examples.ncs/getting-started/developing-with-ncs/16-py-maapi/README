This example shows some aspects of the Python MAAPI  API


This example uses one NCS package. The router package introduced in
../0-router-network.

$ ls ./packages
router

To build the package, do

$ make all

To start the ncs-netsim network, follow the instructions in
../0-router-network, it's the same network here. If you have already started
the simulated network you can omit this step.

$ ncs-netsim start
DEVICE ex0 OK STARTED
DEVICE ex1 OK STARTED
DEVICE ex2 OK STARTED

Start ncs:

$ ncs


Low level MAAPI Python API
==========================

The low level read example prints name, address and port for the three devices.

$ python low-level-read.py
llr: ex0 127.0.0.1 12022
llr: ex1 127.0.0.1 12023
llr: ex2 127.0.0.1 12024


High level MAAPI Python API
==========================

The high level read example is similar to the low-level read example,
but it uses "with contexts" to simplify resource handling. 

The device names are read from the device list with a cursor instance.

$ python high-level-read.py
hlr: ex0 127.0.0.1 12022
hlr: ex1 127.0.0.1 12023
hlr: ex2 127.0.0.1 12024
