This example illustrates how to

- do write and use a pre-modification callback to alter device data outside
  of the FASTMAP algoritm. In this example a new dns server will be set
  permanently

This example uses a simple service package vpnep. This illustrates a service
that will set an interface as an vpn-endpoint on a defined router.
However a prerequisite is that the router has a specified dns server set.
This server should be set on the router permanently and independently
if the is a service instance defined for the router or not.
The router package is the ned package familiar from many of the
getting-started examples

This implies that it is viable to set the dns server in a pre-modification
callback. This implies that the dns server will is set outside of the
FASTMAP algorithm i.e. it will not be automatically be removed when the service
is removed.

First we build and run the vpn-endpoint service and sync-from devices to see
what the initial device configuration looks like.

To build the two packages, do

$ make all

To start the ncs-netsim network, follow the instructions in
../0-router-network, it's the same network here.

$ ncs-netsim start
DEVICE ex0 OK STARTED
DEVICE ex1 OK STARTED
DEVICE ex2 OK STARTED

To run the example we do:

$ ncs

This will start ncs, and ncs will load the two packages, load the
data models defined by the two packages and start the Java code defined
by the packages.

We now start a cli to work with this package:

$ ncs_cli -u admin

We need an initial sync-from devices:

admin@ncs> request devices sync-from
sync-result {
    device ex0
    result true
}
sync-result {
    device ex1
    result true
}
sync-result {
    device ex2
    result true
}

admin@ncs> configure


We check the initial dns server configuration for the device ex0
It should NOT contain the server with ip 10.10.10.1


admin@ncs% show devices device ex0 config r:sys dns
server 10.2.3.4;

We now create and delete a couple of services
since we remove the services again FASTMAP will remove all settings again
but the server 10.10.10.1 is set by a pre-modification callback and
will therefore not be removed.


admin@ncs% set services vpn-endpoint s1 router ex0 iface ethX unit 1 vid 2
admin@ncs% commit

admin@ncs% show devices device ex0 config r:sys dns
server 10.2.3.4;
server 10.10.10.1;

admin@ncs% set services vpn-endpoint s2 router ex0 iface ethX unit 2 vid 3
admin@ncs% commit


We remove both services which will restore the original state of the device

admin@ncs% delete services vpn-endpoint s1
admin@ncs% delete services vpn-endpoint s2
admin@ncs% commit


However the dns server 10.10.10.1 is set permanently since it was set
in a pre-modification callback

admin@ncs% show devices device ex0 config r:sys dns
server 10.2.3.4;
server 10.10.10.1;
