Introduction
============

This README describes various timeouts and locks that we can encounter while
running an NSO instance. The different conditions will be described and we
shall explain how to recognize the various conditions and that the remedy is.



Timeouts
========



Plain data provider timeout.
----------------------------

A 'config false' data provider is responsible for returning operational
data when queried by NSO. If it fails to do so within the stipulated
timeout, NSO will close it's end of the socket to the data provider.

An example of such a data provider can be found in
packages/dp/src/yang/dp.yang which has:

    container test-stats {
      config false;
      tailf:callpoint "test-stats-cp";
      list item {
        key name;
        leaf name {
          type string;
        } 
        leaf i {
          type int32;
        }
      }
    }

This data model is served by the code in:

    packages/dp/src/java/src/com/example/dp/dpDp.java

which has a getElem callback that looks like:

    @DataCallback(callPoint="test-stats-cp",
                  callType=DataCBType.GET_ELEM)
    public ConfValue getElem(DpTrans trans, ConfObject[] keyPath)
        throws DpCallbackException {

        ConfKey k = (ConfKey)keyPath[1];
        if (k.elementAt(0).toString().equals("k1")) {
            try {
                System.out.println("Sleeping 6 secs");
                Thread.sleep(6000);
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
            }
        }
        return new ConfInt32(44);
    }


Normally this is no problem, but if we modify ncs.conf so that it has:

    <japi>
      <query-timeout>PT4S</query-timeout>
    </japi>


The /ncs-config/japi/query-timeout will trigger when we execute:

    $ ncs_cmd -c 'mget /test-stats/item{k1}/i'
    FAILED: maapi_get_elem(ms, mtid, &val, argv[0]), Error: external error (19): application timeout, in function do_maapi_get, line 1449


Or, if CLI is used:

    klacke@ncs> show status test-stats item k1
    ----------------------------------------^
    syntax error: unknown argument
    [error][2016-08-16 15:22:04]

    System message at 2016-08-16 15:22:04...
        Subsystem stopped: ncs-dp-1-dp:DpSkeleton
    klacke@ncs> klacke@ncs>
    System message at 2016-08-16 15:22:06...
        Subsystem started: ncs-dp-3-dp:DpSkeleton
    klacke@ncs>


Some fairly good messages occur in the various logs. If we start with the
NSO main log - ./logs/ncs.log

We see:

    <CRIT> 16-Aug-2016::15:23:55.456 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[31548]: - Daemon ncs-dp-3-dp:DpSkeleton timed out


Which is pretty self explanatory, also the devel.log has a good entry:


    <DEBUG> 16-Aug-2016::15:26:28.958 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[31548]: devel-c get_elem request for callpoint 'test-stats-cp' path /dp:test-stats/item{k1}/i
    <ERR> 16-Aug-2016::15:26:33.971 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[31548]: devel-c Worker socket query timed out daemon 'ncs-dp-3-dp:DpSkeleton' id 25
    <ERR> 16-Aug-2016::15:26:33.972 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[31548]: devel-c get_elem error {external_timeout, ""} for callpoint 'test-stats-cp' path /dp:test-stats/item{k1}/i
    <DEBUG> 16-Aug-2016::15:26:36.439 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[31548]: devel-c New daemon connected (name: ncs-dp-4-dp:DpSkeleton, daemon id: 26)

Two <ERR> messages indicating the timeout, also a subsequent <DEBUG> message
indicating that the recovery code on the Java side is working, the callpoint
is re-registered.

The following sequence of events happened here:

1. A user session is created by ncs_cmd
2. A transaction is created by ncs_cmd asking for /test-stats/item{k1}/i
3. NSO identifies the correct handler for the callpoint, and:
4. NSO invokes INIT in that callpoint handler (data provider)
5. NSO invokes GET_ELEM in that data provider.
6. The timeout is triggered, the socket to the data provider is closed by NSO
7. The Java library code sees that a socket to a data provider is closed,
   the package for that data provider is unloaded and re-loaded
8. Triggering the registration code to reconnect for the data provider.
9. We're good to go again.


On the Java side, the log says:

    <ERROR> 16-Aug-2016::15:26:34.472 Dp NCS-DpMUX-3-dp:DpSkeleton: -

       	... 6 more
    <ERROR> 16-Aug-2016::15:26:34.473 NcsMain NCS-DpMUX-3-dp:DpSkeleton: - Received exception from package 'dp' Message: 'unexpected end of file'

    <INFO> 16-Aug-2016::15:26:36.446 NcsMain NCS-package-restarter: - REDEPLOY ["dp"] --> DONE


An interesting variation on this theme is when we repeatedly invoke:

    $ ncs_cmd -c 'mget /test-stats/item{k1}/i'

If we do it sufficiently many times within a short period of time, the
error is escalated and we see in ncs.log

    <CRIT> 16-Aug-2016::15:24:36.427 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[31548]: - Daemon ncs-dp-2-slowsrv:RFSSkeleton died
    <INFO> 16-Aug-2016::15:24:36.428 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[31548]: - The NCS Java VM terminated
    <INFO> 16-Aug-2016::15:24:36.429 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[31548]: - Starting the NCS Java VM


I.e the library code on the Java side decides to terminate entirely, and it is
subsequently restarted by NSO - as per the configuration in:

    klacke@ncs> show configuration java-vm | details
    auto-start                     true;
    auto-restart                   true;
    ......


The possible remedies to this timeout are:

- Ensure that the data provider code executes faster.
- Raise the ncs.conf timeout for query-timeout.
- The downside of raising the timeout is that it then applies to all
  data providers. If we know that we have callbacks that are slow, it's
  possible for the data provider code to ask for more time using the
  API call DpTrans.dataSetTimeout()
  This entire discussion also applies to action invocations. It is probably
  more common with long running action invocations then it is with long running
  data callbacks.





Fastmap Service create() timeout.
---------------------------------


An Fastmap service is defined by it's Yang code and usually (not necessarily)
by some mapping code written in Java/Python/Erlang
The mapping code gets invoked in a create() call. This call must terminate
within a stipulated timeout as configured by:

    klacke@ncs> show configuration services global-settings service-callback-timeout
    service-callback-timeout 120;

An example of a service taking too long time to execute can be found in

     packages/slowsrv/src/java/src/com/example/slowsrv/slowsrvRFS.java

I've configured the service-callback-timeout to 4 seconds, and the
FastMap create() code sleeps for 6 seconds. Committing from the CLI gives:

    klacke@ncs% set slowsrv s1 sleep-secs 6
    [ok][2016-08-22 13:03:24]

    [edit]
    klacke@ncs% commit
    Aborted: application timeout
    [error][2016-08-22 13:03:31]


The Java log shows similar printouts as in the data provider timeout section
above. We see:

    <ERROR> 22-Aug-2016::13:04:11.118 NcsMain Did-9-Worker-25: - Received exception from package 'slowsrv' Message: 'Not able to detach service transaction'
    <WARN> 22-Aug-2016::13:04:11.118 NcsMain Did-9-Worker-25: - Initializing redeploy package slowsrv
    <ERROR> 22-Aug-2016::13:04:11.300 Dp NCS-DpMUX-5-slowsrv:RFSSkeleton: -
    com.tailf.conf.ConfException: unexpected end of file
       	at com.tailf.conf.ConfInternal.readFill(ConfInternal.java:415)
       	at com.tailf.conf.ConfInternal.termRead(ConfInternal.java:185)
       	at com.tailf.conf.ConfInternal.termRead(ConfInternal.java:113)
       	at com.tailf.dp.Dp.read(Dp.java:1728)
       	at com.tailf.ncs.ctrl.NcsDpMux.run(NcsDpMux.java:175)
       	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
    Caused by: java.io.EOFException

and subsequently we also see:

    <INFO> 22-Aug-2016::13:04:12.714 NcsMain NCS-package-restarter: - REDEPLOY ["slowsrv"]

Thus, the Java library code will redeploy the failing package, thus
automatically re-registering the callback.

The devel.log shows

    <ERR> 22-Aug-2016::13:04:10.795 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[85651]: devel-c Worker socket query timed out daemon 'ncs-dp-5-slowsrv:Slowservice' id 9
    <ERR> 22-Aug-2016::13:04:10.796 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[85651]: devel-c service_create error {external_timeout, ""} for callpoint 'slowsrv-servicepoint' path /slowsrv:slowsrv{s1}

and the ncs.log shows:

    <CRIT> 22-Aug-2016::13:04:10.796 CEC-cwikstro-mac ncs[85651]: - Daemon ncs-dp-5-slowsrv:RFSSkeleton timed out

Similar to the data provider callbacks the remedies to this timeout are:

- Make the create() code execute faster.
- Raise the timeout.
- Ask for additional time, by invoking the API method:
  ServiceContext.setTimeout()



NED timeouts
------------

There are several troublesome timeouts that can be encountered when
we connect and manipulate managed devices.
These timeouts are primarily controlled by the settings in:

    admin@ncs> show configuration devices global-settings | details
    connect-timeout              20;
    read-timeout                 20;
    write-timeout                20;
    .....


It's also possible to change these settings on a per device basis, or
alternatively we can create a device profile as in:

    admin@ncs> show configuration devices profiles
    profile slow-devs {
        connect-timeout 40;
        read-timeout    40;
        write-timeout   40;
    }

and then subsequently refer to this profile in the device meta data config.

For CLI/generic NEDs these timeout numbers are passed to the NED Java code
and that code is responsible for implementing the timeouts accordingly.

We don't want these timeouts to ever trigger during normal operations.
If one of the timeouts trigger during normal service provisioning, it will
manifest itself as an aborted transaction.



Transient errors
----------------


When NSO tries to commit data towards a managed device, a class of errors
called transient errors, make NSO re attempt.
For example, when a NETCONF based device is managed, NSO (sometimes) attempts
to lock the configuration store. If this fails, NSO will attempt to take the
lock (by default) 6 times, sleeping 3 seconds between each attempt.

This is not configurable. We can look at this behavior in the
examples.ncs/getting-started/developing-with-ncs/4-rfs-service example.
Here we log in to one of the emulated routers and grab an exclusive lock.

    $ ncs-netsim cli ex0

    admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on CEC-cwikstro-mac.local
    admin@ex0>configure exclusive
    Entering configuration mode exclusive
    Warning: uncommitted changes will be discarded on exit
    [ok][2016-09-26 10:12:56]


At the NSO layer, we turn on southbound tracing to see what happens.

    $ ncs_cli -u admin

    admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on CEC-cwikstro-mac.local
    admin@ncs> configure
    Entering configuration mode private
    [ok][2016-09-26 10:14:08]

    [edit]
    admin@ncs% set devices global-settings trace pretty
    [ok][2016-09-26 10:14:21]

    [edit]
    admin@ncs% commit
    Commit complete.
    [ok][2016-09-26 10:14:23]

    [edit]

    admin@ncs% set devices device ex0 config r:sys syslog server 3.4.5.6
    [ok][2016-09-26 10:15:00]

    [edit]
    admin@ncs% commit
    Aborted: RPC error towards ex0: lock_denied: the configuration database is locked by session 12 admin console (cli from 127.0.0.1) on since 2016-09-26 10:12:41
    [error][2016-09-26 10:15:18]


If we now take a look at the trace log file, we see 8 consecutive
sequences the following NETCONF RPCs (3 second intervals)

    >>>>out 26-Sep-2016::10:15:03.426 device=ex0 session-id=14

Locks
=====


Debugging locking issues in NSO is hard. When we in a production
system start to get failed service provisioning with the dreaded
'database locked' type of errors it's time to bit the bullet. This
guide tries to help with that.


NETCONF lock / configure exclusive
----------------------------------

There exists a great deal of different locks in the system.
The easiest lock to understand is the lock that is taken by
CLI command 'configure exclusive'

If we in one CLI do:

    admin@ncs> configure exclusive
    Entering configuration mode exclusive
    Warning: uncommitted changes will be discarded on exit
    [ok][2016-08-24 13:19:24]

    [edit]
    admin@ncs%


And then subsequently in another CLI session do:

    admin@ncs> configure exclusive
    Error: configuration database locked by:
    admin console (cli from 127.0.0.1) on since 2016-08-24 13:19:21
            exclusive
    Aborted: configuration locked
    [error][2016-08-24 13:19:48]

it shows that we cannot take two locks, furthermore

    admin@ncs> configure
    Entering configuration mode private
    Current configuration users:
    admin console (cli from 127.0.0.1) on since 2016-08-24 13:19:21 exclusive mode
    [ok][2016-08-24 13:29:14]

    [edit]
    admin@ncs% delete aaa
    [ok][2016-08-24 13:29:19]

    [edit]
    admin@ncs% commit
    Aborted: the configuration database is locked by session 30 admin console (cli from 127.0.0.1) on since 2016-08-24 13:19:21
    [error][2016-08-24 13:29:35]


shows that as long as the exclusive lock is in place, no one can edit
the configuration. So who is that pesky 'session 30'

    admin@ncs% run show users
    SID USER  CTX FROM      PROTO   LOGIN    CONFIG MODE
    *31 admin cli 127.0.0.1 console 14:04:25 private
    30 admin cli 127.0.0.1 console 14:01:00 exclusive

Which accidentally also makes the point of not having a shared
'admin' user.

This last operation took 15 seconds to execute:

    admin@ncs% timecmd commit
    Aborted: the configuration database is locked by session 36 admin console (cli from 127.0.0.1) on since 2016-08-24 13:19:21
    Command executed in 15.08 sec

    [error][2016-08-24 13:38:48]


This is controlled by the ncs.conf parameter:

       /ncs-config/commit-retry-timeout (xs:duration | infinity) [PT15S]
           Commit timeout in the NCS backplane. This timeout controls for how
           long the commit operation will attempt to complete the operation
           when some other entity is locking the database, e.g. some other
           commit is in progress or some managed object is locking the
           database.

The default value is 15 seconds. For many applications this is way to low.
More on this later in this guide.

Similarly, if a NETCONF client executes the <lock> RPC, we get similar
behavior:

To trigger this, in one shell we do:

    $ ssh -s admin@localhost -p 2022 netconf
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <hello xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
          <capabilities>
            <capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.0</capability>
          </capabilities>
        </hello>
    ]]>]]>
    <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"

Leaving the SSH connection open, thus holding the lock.

In another we do:

Slow commit that holds lock for too long
----------------------------------------

Some transactions may run for too long time. Typical scenarios when this
happen are:

- We modify remote devices that are slow
- We make massive changes to a device, which then is slow
- The transaction spans a large number of devices.

Regardless, once a transaction has reached a certain point in it's life
(we call it trans-lock) no other transactions are allowed to pass that
point. Thus at a certain point in the life of a transaction (the trans-lock
point) NSO serializes the execution. Only one transaction is allowed be
in this state at a given time.

Unless commit-queues are used, the actual modification of managed devices
under /devices/device is executed under the trans-lock. Thus, unless
commit-queues are used, only one transaction at a time can modify the network.

In this example we added some code using the external DB interface
making it possible to have the commit of a transaction take an inordinate
amount of time so that we can show the effects of "slow" transactions.

This code resides in packages/extern-db and it has YANG code:

    container extern {
      tailf:callpoint workPoint;
        leaf sleep-secs {
          type int32;
        }
    }

and accompanying Java code that sleeps 'sleep-secs' in the commit callback.
Thus we have:

    admin@ncs% set extern sleep-secs 3
    [ok][2016-09-12 13:33:55]

    [edit]
    admin@ncs% timecmd commit
    Commit complete.
    Command executed in 3.01 sec

    [ok][2016-09-12 13:34:00]

To drive these slow transactions, we have created an action which creates
a user session, a read-write transaction and sets the the /extern/sleep-secs
value. This fairly well mimics the use cases cited above with e.g slow
devices. This action resides in packages/slowsrv and has Yang code:


    container example {
      tailf:action a1 {
        tailf:actionpoint a1;
        input {
          leaf sleep-secs {
            type int32;
          }
          leaf system-session {
            type boolean;
          }
        }
      }
    }

If we invoke that action as:

    admin@ncs> request example a1 system-session false sleep-secs 2000

We get a long running transaction running as the "admin" user. This session
shows in CLI under:

    admin@ncs> show users
    SID USER  CTX     FROM      PROTO   LOGIN    CONFIG MODE
    *77 admin cli     127.0.0.1 console 14:59:28
     75 admin example 127.0.0.1 tcp     14:52:15 private
     69 admin cli     127.0.0.1 console 14:51:25

and is shows from shell command 'ncs --status' as:

    $ ncs --status
    .....
    user sessions:

      sessionId=75 2016-09-12 14:52:15 admin@127.0.0.1 example/tcp com.example.slowsrv.slowTrans.setData
           no locks set
           transaction tid=204 has the trans lock on running
           transactions:
              tid=204 db=running mode=read_write com.example.slowsrv.slowTrans.setData

    .....


If we now, while this long running transaction resides in the 'trans lock' phase
also try to do something else:

    [edit]
    admin@ncs% delete aaa
    [ok][2016-09-12 15:01:50]

    [edit]
    admin@ncs% commit
    Aborted: the configuration database is locked by session 75 admin tcp (example from 127.0.0.1) on since 2016-09-12 14:52:15
       com.example.slowsrv.slowTrans.setData
    [error][2016-09-12 15:02:06]


What happened here is that this new transaction failed due to the ncs.conf
timeout called /ncs-config/commit-retry-timeout
The default value for this timeout is 15 seconds. For many deployments this
is way too low. It can be argued that the timeout should be 'infinity'
In general, we never want northbound transactions to fail due to other
long running transactions, we want all transactions to be queued and run
eventually. Long running transactions are not an error, it's normal.

In NSO 4.2 and earlier, so called 'system sessions' did not show in the
output from 'ncs --status' making it inherently difficult to track down
'database locked' situations. As of 4.3, also 'system sessions' show there
and we also get additional data indicating which code (if any) started
the session.

The remedy to this is to set the ncs.conf parameter
/ncs-config/commit-retry-timeout to infinity or to a very large number such
as 15 minutes. We recommend infinity.



CDB subscriber that never finishes
----------------------------------

A common error over the years, especially for Java based CDB subscribers
is code that subscribes to CDB and forgets to call sync() on the
subscription socket. A CDB subscriber needs to be an application component.
It must run as a thread. This is the same for Java/Erlang/Python subscribers.
The archetypical Java CDB subscriber looks something like:

    public void run() {
        try {
            while (true) {
                int[] points;

                try {
                    points = sub.read();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    return;
                }

                EnumSet<DiffIterateFlags> enumSet =
                    EnumSet.<DiffIterateFlags>of(
                        DiffIterateFlags.ITER_WANT_PREV,
                        DiffIterateFlags.ITER_WANT_ANCESTOR_DELETE,
                        DiffIterateFlags.ITER_WANT_SCHEMA_ORDER);

                int th = -1;
                try {
                    th = maapi.startTrans(Conf.DB_RUNNING, Conf.MODE_READ);
                    NavuContainer root = new NavuContainer(maapi, th, Ncs.hash);
                    sub.diffIterate(points[0], new Iter(sub, root),
                                    enumSet, null);

                    sub.sync(CdbSubscriptionSyncType.DONE_OPERATIONAL);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    // ignore
                    ;
                }
                finally {
                    maapi.finishTrans(th);
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error("", e);
        }
    }

With the above code, it's paramount that the call to sub.diffIterate() never
throws. If it does, we'll throw over the call to sub.sync() and the CDB socket
is locked for ever.
