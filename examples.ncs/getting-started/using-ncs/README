This is the getting started for NCS users example collection.

All examples contained here show different ways of running NCS towards
real and/or simulated devices using NETCONF or other NEDs. All
examples have a README file (indeed most examples only have a README
file) which will explain what the example tries to demonstrate, and
will contain commands that can be copied and pasted into a shell to
try them out.


Before running any of the examples, make sure to source the rc file
(called ncsrc, for bourne type shells and ncsrc.tcsh for csh/tcsh) to
properly set up your path and other environment variables. The rc file
can be found at the very top of the NCS installation directory.
