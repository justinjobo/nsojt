In this example an existing device which supports NETCONF will be made
into an NCS package using only it's YANG file. The assumption is that
we have somehow gotten the devices YANG file, and saved it in this
directory (it is called host.yang).

Preparations
------------

1) Make sure you have sourced the ncsrc file in $NCS_DIR. This sets up paths and
   environment variables in order to run NCS. So this must be done all times
   before running NCS, so it is recommended to put that in your profile.

First create a package called 'host' from the YANG file we have

  $ ncs-make-package --netconf-ned . host


We now need to build the YANG file in the package

  $ ( cd host/src && make )



If we want to add simulated devices of this kind we simply:

  $ ncs-netsim create-network host 2 h

And then:

  $ ncs-setup --dest .

If we didn't want simulated devices we still want NCS to find our
package. Either mv it to the packages directory, or create a symbolic link:

  $ (cd packages && ln -s ../host .)

(Note: the link will already be there if ncs-netsim is used)


Start everything

  $ ncs-netsim start
  $ ncs
  $ ncs_cli -u admin

  > show packages
  > request devices sync-from


The simulated devices will already be added to the config. For real
devices add them using the CLI (same method as described in the
2-real-device-c7200 example)

Do not forget to stop ncs before moving on:

  $ ncs --stop

If you want to restore the example to the initial configuration do:
  $ ncs-setup --reset
