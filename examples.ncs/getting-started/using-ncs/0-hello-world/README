Hello World
-----------

The purpose of this example is to start NCS, understand the different
directories and files NCS uses. As well as starting the NCS CLI, and
Web UI.

Preparations
------------
1) Make sure you have sourced the ncsrc file in $NCS_DIR. This sets up paths and
   environment variables in order to run NCS. So this must be done all times
   before running NCS, so it is recommended to put that in your profile.

Optional:
If you do not want to create the example files in the NCS installation
directory $NCS_DIR/examples.ncs/getting-started/using-ncs/0-hello-world,
for example if you are several users sharing the same installation, you can
run the example in a separate directory.

2) Create an empty directory, for example in your home directory. NCS and the
   simulator will create files and directories in this example. Make sure you
   change to this directory before continuing.

NCS runs as a daemon, and needs a couple of directories (for logs, its
database etc). The location of all these are in a configuration file,
usually called ncs.conf. Unless supplied as an argument (using the -c
option) the NCS daemon will look for ./ncs.conf, followed by
etc/ncs/ncs.conf in the NCS installation directory. In order to make
it easy to get started NCS includes a script called ncs-setup, this
script will create the directories and files needed to get started (by
default in the current working directory).

  $ ls

  $ ncs-setup --dest .
  $ ls
  README.ncs          ncs-cdb/        packages/
  logs/     	      ncs.conf        state/		scripts/

An initial configuration file, ./ncs.conf and the directories need to
run NCS were created. Now, to start the NCS daemon run "ncs"
(optionally providing the configuration file as argument: -c
./ncs.conf)

  $ ncs

The NCS daemon is now running, we can make sure it is by issuing:

  $ ncs --status

The next thing to do is to start the CLI. The CLI is started using the
ncs_cli command. By default you start the CLI as the user you are
running the shell as. Most examples will use a default built-in user
called 'admin', to start the CLI as user admin, use:

  $ ncs_cli -u admin


By default NCS also starts it's built-in SSH server, listening on port
2024. So ssh can also be used to log into the CLI:

  $ ssh -l admin -p 2024 localhost
  admin@localhost's password: 

The default password for the 'admin' user is: admin. Type exit to get
out of the CLI.

  admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using ssh on host.example.org
  admin@host> exit
  Connection to localhost closed.


NCS also starts a web-server, listening on port 8080. By directing a
browser to http://localhost:8080/ you can login using the Web UI with
user admin again.


 stop the NCS daemon use the --stop option:

  $ ncs --stop


NCS will now have lots of logs in the logs directory. The main log
being logs/ncs.log, look at the log to see when it was started, what
files were loaded during start etc

  $ less logs/ncs.log


To wipe all log-files, restore all settings done in NCS, and to revert
to the "empty" factory default configuration, use the --reset option
to ncs-setup.

 $ ncs-setup --reset
