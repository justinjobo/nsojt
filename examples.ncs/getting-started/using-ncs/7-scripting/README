This example illustrates how to use plug and play scripts to add

  - CLI commands
  - policy scripts
  - post-commit callbacks

In this example we rely on this part of ncs.conf:

  <scripts>
    <dir>./scripts</dir>
  </scripts>

which registers ./scripts as a directory where to look for scripts.
There we have one CLI command (echo.sh), one policy script
(check_dir.sh) and one post-commit hook (show_diff.sh).
The directory structure looks like this:

  $ find scripts
  ./scripts
  ./scripts/command
  ./scripts/command/echo.sh
  ./scripts/policy
  ./scripts/policy/check_dir.sh
  ./scripts/post-commit
  ./scripts/post-commit/show_diff.sh

The interface of the scripts are defined by the scripts themselves.
NCS invokes the scripts to determine their interfaces. This is
automatically done at startup and manually on demand via the
"script reload" CLI command. In this case the new CLI command will
be named "my script echo".

This example does not need to be built.

To run it we do:

  $ ncs-setup --dest .
  $ ncs

This will start NCS, and NCS will load the package with the demo
scripts. Now we start the CLI.

  $ ncs_cli -u admin

  admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on tellus

and try the new CLI command "my script echo" out

  admin@ncs> my script ?
  Possible completions:
    echo - Display a line of text
  admin@ncs> my script echo ?
  Possible completions:
    String to be displayed
    file - Redirect output to file
    nolf - Do not output the trailing newline
  admin@ncs> my script echo hello world
  hello world
  [ok][2015-01-16 13:59:38]

Echo is a trivial command, it simply echoes a string, but the
scripts/command/echo.sh script demonstrates how the parameter
handling for CLI command scripts works.

The policy script scripts/policy/check_dir.sh provides an
example of how policies can be enforced. Here we try to
change the trace-dir leaf to a value that the policy script
does not allow.

  admin@ncs% set devices global-settings trace-dir ?
  Description: The directory where trace files are stored
  Possible completions:
    <string>[./logs]
  admin@ncs% set devices global-settings trace-dir ./mybad
  [ok][2015-01-16 14:02:19]

  [edit]
  admin@ncs% validate
  Failed: /devices/global-settings/trace-dir: must retain it original value (./logs)
  [error][2015-01-16 14:02:26]

The post commit script scripts/post-commit/show_diff.sh provides a
simple example of a side effect can be performed just before a
transaction is ended. The script relies on an environment variable
so we need to restart NCS in order to make it take effect.

  admin@ncs% exit
  [ok][2015-01-16 14:04:02]
  admin@ncs> exit
  $ ncs --stop

Now we set the variable and start NCS again

  $ cat my_trace_file.txt
  cat: my_trace_file.txt: No such file or directory
  $ export TEST_POST_COMMIT_SHOW_DIFF_FILE=my_trace_file.txt
  $ ncs
  $ ncs_cli -u admin

  admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on tellus
  admin@ncs> configure
  Entering configuration mode private
  [ok][2015-01-16 14:07:33]

  [edit]
  admin@ncs% set devices global-settings read-timeout ?
  Description: Timeout in seconds used when reading data
  Possible completions:
    <unsignedInt>[20]
  admin@ncs% set devices global-settings read-timeout 30
  [ok][2015-01-16 14:07:53]

  [edit]
  admin@ncs% commit
  Commit complete.
  [ok][2015-01-16 14:07:56]

Now we exit from the CLI and take a look at the side effect

  [edit]
  admin@ncs% exit
  [ok][2015-01-16 14:07:58]
  admin@ncs> exit
  $ cat my_trace_file.txt

When plug and play scripts have been created, updated or deleted there
is no need for restarting NCS. The scripts may be reloaded with the
command "script reload". The reload command may also be used to get
various details of information about the scripts

  $ ncs_cli -u admin

  admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on tellus

  admin@ncs> script reload ?
  Possible completions:
    all    - Show info about all scripts
    debug  - Show additional debug info about the scripts
    diff   - Show info about scripts changed since last reload
    errors - Show info about erroneous scripts

Do not forget to stop NCS before moving on:

  $ ncs --stop

If you want to restore the example to the initial configuration do:
  $ ncs-setup --reset
