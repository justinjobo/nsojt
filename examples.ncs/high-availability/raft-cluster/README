HA Raft Cluster
===============

The example shows the steps to initially set up an HA Raft cluster.
It includes securing the cluster by provisioning node certificates
and the way the cluster behaves when nodes go down and come up again.

Cluster setup steps consist of first preparing each individual node
(ncs.conf, certificate and key pair) and then running the
`ha-raft create-cluster` action.

Note that when using seed nodes for discovery, the potential cluster
member nodes will show in the `ha-raft status connected-node` list
before you actually join them to the cluster. This signifies the
underlying transport (TCP/TLS) connection is working correctly.

A gen_tls_certs.sh shell script is used to create a dedicated CA for
signing PKI certificates for individual nodes and a do-nothing service
called 'dummies' is used for observing how the replication takes place.

To start the example, run:

    ./demo.sh

The demo script will guide you through the procedure step by step,
providing explanations along the way. Alternatively, you can use
'./demo.sh -n` to run the example straight through.

If you wish to simply use this example as a sandbox for your own
exploration or testing, you can start with a clean state where the
cluster is initiated with n1 as the leader and n2 and n3 as followers:

    make stop clean
    make all start

    NCS_IPC_PORT=4561 ncs_cli -C -u admin -g admin

    admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on rhubarb
    admin@n1# ha-raft create-cluster member [ ncsd2@127.0.0.1 ncsd3@127.0.0.1 ]
    admin@n1#

After you are finished, run:

    make stop clean

to clean up and release used resources.
