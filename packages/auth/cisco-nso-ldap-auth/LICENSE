License texts:

---- python-ldap License ----

The python-ldap project comes with a LICENCE file.

We are aware that its text is unclear, but it cannot be changed: all
authors of python-ldap would need to approve the licence change, but a
complete list of all the authors is not available. (Note that the Git
repository of the project is incomplete. Furthermore, commits imported
from CVS lack authorship information; users "stroeder" or "leonard" are
commiters (reviewers), but sometimes not authors of the committed code.)

The current maintainers assume that the license is the sentence that
refers to "Python-style license" and assume this means a highly
permissive open source license that only requires preservation of the
text of the LICENCE file (including the disclaimer paragraph).

All contributions committed since July 1st, 2021, as well as some past
contributions, are licensed under the MIT license. The MIT licence and
more details are listed in the file LICENCE.MIT.
